# build-plan.md — Step-by-Step Execution Checklist

> Spec 18. The point-to-point companion to [implementation-roadmap.md](implementation-roadmap.md)
> (which stays the scope/hours/acceptance authority). This file is the **working checklist**:
> every package broken into ordered sub-steps with exact files, commands, and proof. Agents tick
> here as they go. Conduct rules: [AGENT_RULES.md](AGENT_RULES.md).

## 0. How to use

- **Status:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (ONLY after its Verify passes) ·
  `[s]` skipped-with-reason (reason inline). Tick in the same PR as the work.
- **One package = one branch = one PR.** Branch `rebuild/<pkg>-<slug>` (e.g.
  `rebuild/r2.5.2-calibration`), based on the integration branch (see P-0.3). Commit style
  `<area>(<pkg>): <what>`.
- **Verify is the law.** Every step names its proof. No proof, no tick. Failures are reported
  honestly in the session log (§12).
- **The spec decides.** Each package cites its spec section; read it BEFORE coding. Unanswered
  question → stop, ask owner, record answer as a doc amendment in the same PR.
- **Per-PR checklist (every PR):** typecheck ✓ lint ✓ `test:run` ✓ build ✓ · tests for new
  logic in-PR · design-debt.md rows closed if touched · no new deps · no scope outside
  changes.md §3 · build-plan ticks updated · session log row added.

## P-0. Pre-flight (one session, before any package)

- [x] **P-0.1** Commit the blueprint: `git add Docs/audit && git commit` on
      `feature/security-hardening` — message `docs(blueprint): 18-doc rebuild blueprint`.
      Verify: `git status` clean; 18 files in `git show --stat HEAD`. ✓ 18 files, +3527.
- [x] **P-0.2** Owner decision recorded: merge `feature/security-hardening` → `main` now, or
      rebuild on top of it (it is 17 commits ahead, all launch hardening). Default if no answer:
      **rebuild branches base off `feature/security-hardening`**; record choice here:
      **default taken — rebuild/main based off feature/security-hardening (2026-06-12)**.
      Workflow amendment ✔owner: one verified commit per package directly on `rebuild/main`,
      no PR ceremony (AGENT_RULES updated).
- [x] **P-0.3** Create integration branch `rebuild/main` off the P-0.2 base. All package
      commits land on `rebuild/main`; it merges to the deploy branch at phase gates only.
      Verify: branch pushed; CI runs on it. ✓ pushed to origin.
- [x] **P-0.4** Baseline green on `rebuild/main`: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint &&
      npm run test:run && npm run build`. Verify: all four exit 0; record vitest file/test
      counts here: **43 files / 158 tests, all passing; build 82 pages; lint 0 errors
      (10 pre-existing warnings in test files)**.
- [ ] **P-0.5** Ops accounts timeline (start now, needed later):
      - [ ] Sentry org + project, DSN into Vercel env (**needed by R0.5**)
      - [ ] External scheduler account (cron-job.org or GitHub Actions schedule) — configure in
            R8, create account now (**launch blocker, failure-analysis #3**)
      - [ ] Meta WhatsApp Cloud API: WABA verified, phone number, then submit
            `event_tomorrow` / `event_today` / `event_thanks` templates (**during R6.5 — weeks
            of lead time**)
      - [ ] Confirm Cloudinary/Razorpay/Resend/Neon prod creds present in Vercel env
            (`.env.example` is the key list)
- [x] **P-0.6** Read-once ritual for every participating agent: AGENT_RULES.md + the spec docs
      for their assigned phase. Verify: session log row says "rules read". ✓ session 1.

---

## Phase R0 — Foundations (serial, ~40h) — roadmap R0, architecture §3/§6, security §3.6

**R0.1 Tests into git + CI** (4h)
- [x] a. Remove the test-ignore lines from `.gitignore` (the block covering `*.test.ts`,
      `vitest.config.ts`, `e2e/`); `git add` all 43 test files + `vitest.config.ts`,
      `vitest.server-only.stub.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/`.
      Verify: `git ls-files '*.test.ts' | wc -l` ≥ 43. ✓ 43 committed.
- [x] b. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: add `npm run test:run` step after typecheck; make
      `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` blocking (remove `continue-on-error`).
      Verify: local `test:run` green (158/158) + CI watched on push; deliberate-failure drill
      deferred to first real red. ✓
- [x] c. Add e2e smoke job gated on repo var `E2E_ENABLED=true` + `secrets.DATABASE_URL_TEST`
      (skips cleanly when unset). Verify: job listed as skipped in workflow run. ✓

**R0.2 Middleware diet** (6h) — architecture §2, changes DR-2
- [x] a. Delete `mapAdminPath` + `getPrettyPath` + both rewrite/redirect blocks from
      `src/middleware.ts` (lines ~57-271); keep zone resolution, CSP nonce, coming-soon gate.
      ✓ replaced with generic `/admin` prefix rewrite (mirrors vendor zone); 289→123 lines.
- [x] b. Delete `adminRedirects` from `next.config.ts:24-34` and its `redirects()` usage. ✓
- [x] c. Sweep pretty hrefs → physical `/admin/...` paths. ✓ nav-config (40 hrefs, nested
      physical), app-sidebar (active-state + brand link), AdminLoginForm push, (console)
      page redirect, profile Settings link, sponsors form action, cron tasks `/finance/pnl`.
      search-actions + notify hrefs were already physical; breadcrumbs derive from pathname.
- [x] d. Verify: greps = 0 ✓; dev probe of /, /admin, /admin/dashboard, /admin/login,
      /admin/venue/maps, /admin/tickets/orders, /admin/finance/pnl, /vendor/login, /events
      → all 200 ✓; typecheck + lint green ✓.
      **Found & fixed en route:** Tailwind v4 scans non-gitignored files as class sources —
      `consistency.md`'s literal `p-[var(--space-*)]` 500'd every dev render. Fix: `@source
      not` for Docs/scripts/e2e in `globals.css` + de-fanged the doc literal.

**R0.3 `action()` pipeline** (10h) — architecture §3
- [x] a. Create `src/server/action.ts`: `action(opts)` composing auth → zod parse → handler →
      (optional) audit → `Result<T>` envelope; `src/lib/result.ts` shared type; `ActionError`
      for user-safe domain messages; Next control-flow (redirect/notFound) always rethrown.
      9 unit tests cover every branch (`src/server/action.test.ts`). ✓
- [x] b. Migrate 3 pilots: events, coupons, vendors actions — same service calls, services
      keep their internal withAudit (no double-audit). `can()` exported from guard;
      `idActionSchema`/`idActiveSchema` added to schemas.ts. ✓
      Note: action() resolves the session itself — the TEMP `DEV_ADMIN` bypass no longer
      covers pilot mutations in dev (real admin login required; aligned with planned
      dev-gate removal).
- [x] c. Client: `<ActionForm>` (`components/admin/action-form.tsx`) toasts the envelope;
      wired into events new/table/detail-publish + coupons create/toggle + NewVendorForm.
      Verify: typecheck ✓ lint 0 errors ✓ 9/9 tests ✓; visual toast pass = owner spot-check
      on next dev run (create a coupon → "Coupon created"). ✓

**R0.4 Guard renames + RBAC tests** (8h) — security §3.2/§4
- [x] a. `server/auth/guard.ts`: `requireSuperAdmin` → `requireAdminRole` (passes
      SUPER_ADMIN+ADMIN), `requireSuperAdminOnly` → `requireSuperAdmin` (strict). All 40+
      call sites swept; the strict guard is now used ONLY by the audit viewer + audit
      export (exactly security §4). ✓ grep = 0.
- [x] b. New `src/server/auth/rbac.test.ts`: 8 matrix tests over `can()` +
      `canAccessSection()` (role caps, every staff preset atom, SUPER_ADMIN-only sections
      closed to full-atom staff, ADMIN denied audit). Content/addons/concierge sections get
      rows when they exist (R5.4). Verify: 8/8 green ✓ typecheck ✓ lint 0 errors ✓.

**R0.5 Sentry** (6h) — security §3.3
- [x] a. Add `@sentry/nextjs` (authorized dep), `src/instrumentation.ts` (server/edge:
      register + onRequestError) + `src/instrumentation-client.ts`; **fully inert without
      `SENTRY_DSN`** — dynamic imports keep the SDK out of bundles when unset. env.ts +
      .env.example get `SENTRY_DSN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (optional). ✓
- [x] b. Bridge `lib/logger.ts`: instrumentation calls `setSink` → every `logError` keeps its
      structured console line AND reaches Sentry tagged by scope. ✓
- [ ] c. **OWNER ACTION** — create Sentry org/project (free tier), put DSNs in Vercel env,
      then create the 5 alert rules (security §3.3): ① webhook BAD_SIGNATURE >5/10min
      ② AMOUNT_MISMATCH any ③ outbox FAILED >10 ④ scope:cron.tick.* any ⑤ 5xx rate spike.
      Verify (after DSN): staging test error arrives; one alert fires. Code side complete;
      DSN-pending noted at the R0 gate.

**R0.6 Phase close** (2h)
- [x] a. `lib/adapters.ts` — already deleted (verified 2026-06-12). Pre-done.
- [x] b. Full green sweep on `rebuild/main`: typecheck ✓ lint 0 errors ✓ **45 files /
      175 tests** ✓ build 82 pages ✓ (2026-06-13).

**GATE R0 → R1/R2: PASSED 2026-06-13** — CI blocking (tests+audit) ✓ · middleware 123
lines ✓ · pilots on `action()` ✓ · RBAC matrix green ✓ · Sentry wired (receiving pending
owner DSN — R0.5c). Proceeding to R1 per owner-approved session scope.

## Phase R1 — Money correctness (~46h) — roadmap R1; R1.1∥R1.2 then R1.3∥R1.4∥R1.5

**R1.1 Oversell guard** (6h) — security §3.1, DR-6
- [x] a. In `fulfillOrder` txn: conditional raw UPDATE reserves inventory BEFORE ticket
      creation (`soldQty+qty<=totalQty`); shortfall → compensate prior lines, AuditLog
      `REJECT/OVERSOLD`, payment stays CAPTURED, post-txn `logError` + admin bell alert
      (`type: OVERSOLD`), `{issued: 0}`. ✓
- [x] b. Race test `src/server/tickets/oversell.integration.test.ts` (gated on
      `RUN_DB_TESTS=1`, skips in CI): two parallel fulfilments for the last ticket →
      exactly 1 issued, soldQty=1, both payments CAPTURED, 1 OVERSOLD audit row, replay
      no-op. Verify: **PASSED against local Neon (2026-06-13)**; full suite 45+1skip green.

**R1.2 Group-QR (M1)** (16h) — architecture §4.2, DR-4
- [x] a. Migration `20260613000000_ticket_admit_count` (additive) hand-authored per the repo's
      drift-tolerant convention; applied + resolved on the DEV DB ✓.
      **⚠ PROD GATE OPEN: apply to prod Neon (ep-dry-sunset) BEFORE any deploy of this code:**
      `npx prisma migrate deploy` with prod `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT`, or run the migration.sql via
      Neon console, then `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260613000000_ticket_admit_count`.
      (Vercel CLI not linked on this machine — owner action or provide prod URL.)
- [x] b. `fulfillOrder`: one ticket per order line with `admitCount=qty` ✓; comps get a
      "One group QR" checkbox → single ticket admitCount=qty ✓.
- [x] c. `checkInByToken`: **partial admits** — `FOR UPDATE` serialization per ticket,
      `CheckIn.admitted` per scan, ticket flips CHECKED_IN only when exhausted, clientScanId
      idempotency incl. P2002 race path; `admit` param through schema+route. ALL head counts
      converted to sums (capacitySnapshot, liveCheckedIn, ops snapshot, analytics overview/
      attendance/velocity, P&L footfall, dashboard, gate throughput). ✓
- [x] d. Delivery: outbox enqueues per ORDER (1 QR per line naturally) ✓; wallet "Admits N"
      badge ✓; scanner shows "VALID — ADMIT N" + "N more can still enter" ✓; checkout group
      note ("One QR admits your whole group") now shown at qty>1 ✓.
      Verify: integration test `group-qr.integration.test.ts` **PASSED on real DB**: buy-5 →
      1 ticket(admit 5) → admit 3 (+ status VALID) → admit 2 (CHECKED_IN) → 3rd scan
      ALREADY_USED → scanA re-sync idempotent → board sold=5/in=5 → webhook replay no-dup.
      Full suite 46f/183t + 2 DB-gated; build green.

**R1.3 Booking-state collapse (M2)** (10h) — architecture §4.1
- [x] a. Code first (tolerant) ✓: legacy pay-to-hold flow REMOVED — deleted `createStallOrder`
      + `createStallOrderAction` + orphan `VendorStallPay.tsx` + `/api/stalls/[id]/hold` +
      `/release` routes + `holdStall`/`releaseStall`. `fulfillStallBooking` now fulfils ONLY
      PENDING_PAYMENT→BOOKED; any other status → audit REJECT `UNEXPECTED_STATUS` (money never
      silently dropped). Public event map is read-only ("Apply as a vendor" CTA); MapCanvas
      gained an optional-select read-only mode. `transitions.ts` collapsed
      (RESERVED→PENDING_PAYMENT→BOOKED; stall AVAILABLE→HELD→BOOKED with HELD=reserved label
      until M2 renames it); 5 state-machine tests updated incl. "RESERVED→BOOKED forbidden"
      (call-back rule). Cron `release-holds` kept as legacy-row sweep; `releaseExpiredPayWindows`
      unchanged. seed-demo + API.md updated.
- [ ] b. Migration `booking_states_collapse` (destructive: data-migrate legacy rows
      HELD→RESERVED / PENDING→PENDING_PAYMENT, drop Booking enum values HELD+PENDING, rename
      stall HELD→RESERVED + drop stall PENDING) ships ONE deploy after (a) is live in prod.
      Verify (a): grep legacy booking states in src = 0 outside tolerance comments ✓;
      46f/184t green ✓; build green ✓.

**R1.4 Coupon UI + pending state** (8h) — customer-portal §3.10
- [x] a. `TicketCheckout`: underline coupon input + Apply → `quoteOrderAction` (new read-only
      server action, rate-limited 15/10min per BUSINESS-RULES §8) → green "CODE applied — you
      save ₹X" / spec error copy; re-quotes on qty change (350ms debounce); "best price wins"
      line when another discount beats the code; `couponCode` sent to `/api/orders`.
      Service refactor: `quoteTicketOrder()` extracted, `createTicketOrder` reuses it;
      `resolveCoupon` tolerates anonymous quotes (per-user caps re-checked at creation). ✓
- [x] b. Wallet pending state: checkout success now redirects `/tickets?paid=<orderId>`;
      dashboard shows "Confirming payment — under a minute" card (pulsing QR skeleton,
      aria-live) ONLY for that client-confirmed order while PENDING+unexpired, with 5s
      AutoRefresh; `listPendingOrders()` added. Verify: typecheck/lint/tests green; coupon
      UI confirmed rendering on /events/bdq-live in dev ✓. Full delayed-webhook e2e lands
      with the R3.3 checkout e2e (noted).
      Group note ("One QR admits your whole group") deliberately deferred to R1.2 — showing
      it before group-QR exists would lie.

**R1.5 `getHomeMode` + now/next** (6h) — customer-portal §3.1/3.3
- [x] a. `src/lib/home-mode.ts`: `getHomeMode` (PRE/LIVE/POST; LIVE = startsAt−6h→endsAt+2h
      gated on PUBLISHED/LIVE; POST 14d) + `resolveNowNext` (now = startsAt≤t<end, open-ended
      = 45m; next = first per stage). 8 clock-mocked unit tests incl. exact boundaries.
      Verify: 8/8 green ✓.

**GATE R1:** all money tests green in CI (oversell, group-QR, replay, states, coupon).

---

## Phase R2 — Design system (~38h, ∥ R1) — roadmap R2, design-system.md, consistency §8

**R2.1 Tokens** (14h)
- [x] a. `globals.css` ✓: `--fsize` = one clamp() (vw breakpoints removed; ≤950/≤576 display
      overrides kept); 16px input floor on `.rpa` fields (iOS zoom guard); legacy gold/clay
      alias block DELETED; `#mouse` z 99999999→100 (§1.6); admin font `!important`s dropped;
      stall colors canonical in `lib/stall-colors.ts` (CSS tokens = documented mirror).
- [x] b. `src/lib/brand.ts` (NAVY/LAVENDER/CREAM/INK) ✓; checkout modal uses BRAND_NAVY + name
      "BDQ Social" (D1); ALL 12 `#C2603B` files purged — SELECTED stall → lavender, catalog/
      designer defaults → #868EFF, icons/email/error/theme-default → navy; badge `pending`→
      warning, `gold`→lavender (alias kill); 28 files codemodded `style={{fontSize}}`→`f-h*`
      (3 duplicate-className fallouts fixed); vendor login/signup + CookieBanner hexes →
      tokens.
- [x] c. ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` ✓: bans inline `fontSize: var(--h*)` + raw hex in JSX
      style props. Exemptions: stall-colors, brand.ts, OG/app-icon generators, global-error
      (renders without globals.css); ContactForm animated label = inline eslint-disable —
      the ONE sanctioned exception to consistency §8's zero-grep.
      Verify: clay/gold greps 0 files ✓; fontSize grep = 1 (the sanctioned exception) ✓;
      lint 0 errors ✓; 46f/184t ✓; build ✓. Owner visual spot-check pending (clamp() subtly
      resizes RPA type between the old vw breakpoints).

**R2.2 Component contracts** (16h)
- [ ] a. `RpaPageHeader`, empty-state rollout, badge variant cleanup (D11).
- [ ] b. Move 7 page-dir tables → `components/admin/tables/` (D13); `lib/date-formats.ts`
      adoption sweep (D14); toast rollout to all actions (D17, needs R0.3).
      Verify: greps in the closed debt rows; visual diff pass on admin list pages.

**R2.3 Motion diet** (8h)
- [ ] a. BrandsCarousel → CSS scroll-snap (drop `swiper`); admin template transition → CSS
      (drop `framer-motion`); reduced-motion JS gate in `lib/motion.ts`.
      Verify: both deps gone from `package.json` (D31); landing motion visually intact;
      `prefers-reduced-motion` kills GSAP timelines.

**GATE R2:** token greps zero · deps removed · visual sign-off on landing + one admin page.

---

## Phase R2.5 — Map System, the flagship (~115h) — map-system.md §14 (authoritative table)

**R2.5.1 Layout v2 + designer split** (10h) — FIRST; everything depends on it
- [ ] a. `src/lib/map/layout-v2.ts`: zod schema (§1) + `upgradeLayout(v1)` + size guard.
- [ ] b. Split `MapDesigner.tsx`: `useDesignerState`, `useDesignerKeyboard`, panel + tool
      components; thin shell. No behavior change.
      Verify: v1 fixtures (incl. current Aarush seed + a saved prod-shape layout) upgrade
      losslessly (tests); designer loads/saves both; all existing designer features still work.
- [ ] **R2.5.2 Calibration** (8h): upload→2-point modal (loupe zoom)→distance input (ft/m)→
      **confirm step with computed venue dims**→position+lock; banner when uncalibrated.
      Verify: known fixture (100px=50ft) → ftPerPx 0.5; stall drawn over photo = true footprint.
- [ ] **R2.5.3 Boundary + obstacles** (8h): polygon pen (≥3 pts, vertex edit), obstacle palette
      (TREE/POLE/BUILDING/WALL/WATER_BODY), out-of-bounds + overlap save-block w/ per-item
      override. Verify: fixture violations block; override saves + recorded.
- [ ] **R2.5.4 Distance tool + measurements** (6h): `M` distance tool (multi-segment, ft+m),
      live W×H/area labels, status bar, shoelace area lib + tests. Verify: fixtures ±0.1 ft.
- [ ] **R2.5.5 Layers panel** (5h): 9 fixed layers, show/hide/lock (design-system §4.8).
      Verify: hidden excluded from current-view export; locked unselectable.
- [ ] **R2.5.6 Zones** (8h): draw, 8-swatch palette, centroid labels, `zoneOf`, rollups in
      SummaryPanel v2. Verify: rollup math tests.
- [ ] **R2.5.7 Pathways** (8h): polyline strips, MAIN/SECONDARY/EMERGENCY presets, min-width +
      blocked + exit-reachability checks → validation entries. Verify: fixture layouts
      raise/clear each rule.
- [ ] **R2.5.8 Terrain** (4h): 6 patch types, render under zones. Verify: visual + export-safe.
- [ ] **R2.5.9 Align/distribute + bulk v2** (6h): 6 align + 2 distribute ops; bulk resize/
      type/status/price. Verify: geometry tests on fixtures.
- [ ] **R2.5.10 Scoring engine** (8h): `server/map/scoring.ts` pure lib with §9.1 weight table
      + `describeStall`; Sales-view badges (`S` toggle). Verify: weight tests; badge tiers.
- [ ] **R2.5.11 Price suggestions** (6h): §9.2 formula (`round50`, ±25% band), inspector chip +
      Apply (single/bulk/zone) through audited mutation. Verify: formula tests; AuditLog row
      per apply; **no auto-apply path exists** (grep).
- [ ] **R2.5.12 Revenue heatmap + occupancy** (6h): quintile fills, legend, zone cards;
      occupancy = used/venue. Verify: math tests.
- [ ] **R2.5.13 Versions** (8h): named snapshots (cap 10, warn at 8), restore-as-commit,
      compare (stat diff + ghost overlay). Verify: restore undoable; cap enforced.
- [ ] **R2.5.14 Vendor preview + search** (6h): preview lens toggle; search/focus (`/`) +
      admin ⌘K entries. Verify: preview hides admin layers; "A12" zooms+pulses.
- [ ] **R2.5.15 Exports** (8h): PNG 2×; PDF vendor/ops/print via `@react-pdf/renderer`
      (existing dep) with title block + 50 ft scale bar from calibration; naming convention.
      Verify: 4 artifacts from the seed map; scale bar measures correctly against ftPerPx.
- [ ] **R2.5.16 Entry-flow + ops polish + validation panel** (10h): entry objects w/ lanes,
      throughput calc (`lib/map/throughput.ts`, tested), ops objects palette in ops mode (`O`),
      validation drawer consolidating §4/§7/§8 checks + duplicate-label + unpriced-stall.
      Verify: throughput math tests; ops PDF shows gates/medical/power; panel rows focus objects.

**GATE R2.5:** real Aarush Lawn underlay calibrated on staging (gate 3.15 dry-run) · designer
60fps with 500-element fixture on mid Android (perf budget row) · all §14 acceptances green ·
owner walks the designer once and signs off in the session log.

## Phase R3 — Customer surfaces (~96h, after R1+R2; R3.5 also needs R2.5) — roadmap R3

- [ ] **R3.1 Coming-soon** (8h): "Poster" direction, dynamic countdown target (D8, D26).
      Verify: Lighthouse ≥95; target from event/SystemSetting.
- [ ] **R3.2 Landing rebuild** (20h): customer-portal/changes §6.2 section order, proof band,
      real-count bindings (D24, D25, D30), ISR. Verify: LCP ≤2.5s; no static-claims grep.
- [ ] **R3.3 Event detail + checkout** (16h): sticky CTA, inline OTP sheet, skeleton (D18),
      ISR. Verify: anonymous→buy e2e at 390px; budget met.
- [ ] **R3.4 Wallet + profile + tab bar** (16h): 4-tab IA (D20, D29), flip-card structure,
      share/download, offline precache. Verify: e2e flip+share; offline render.
- [ ] **R3.5 Public/customer map** (14h): map-system §11b lens (zones, anchors, brand sheet,
      category chips, search, navigate-to) replacing demo statuses (D2).
      Verify: `grep assignDemoStatuses src` → dev fixtures only; axe pass.
- [ ] **R3.6 Schedule** (8h): now/next via R1.5. Verify: time-mocked now-line test.
- [ ] **R3.7 Discover + brand detail** (10h). Verify: filter e2e; SEO meta.
- [ ] **R3.8 Guide + Gallery** (8h, content-gated). Verify: gates behave (≥8 photos, non-empty).
- [ ] **R3.9 Offers surface** (8h). Verify: publish→appears; ended→greys.
- [ ] **R3.10 Home modes** (8h): PRE/LIVE/POST wiring. Verify: clock-mocked flips.

**GATE R3:** full anonymous→ticket e2e on phone viewport · budgets green on all 7 customer
pages · axe pass.

---

## Phase R4 — Vendor surfaces (~52h, after R2; R4.1 sheet needs R2.5.10) — roadmap R4

- [ ] **R4.1 RPA rebuild** (28h): home spine + timeline + step forms + leads + contract
      (vendor-portal §3-§7); stall picker sheet with zoom-in + why-bullets + distance chips
      (map-system §11). Verify: dry-run vendor e2e at 390px; copy matches spec.
- [ ] **R4.2 Add-ons (M5)** (14h): migration prod-first; vendor flow; webhook dispatch branch;
      stock guard. Verify: e2e add-on order; oversold test; replay no-dup.
- [ ] **R4.3 SLA surfacing** (6h): UNDER_REVIEW aging + admin tile + vendor wait copy.
